= mlist

http://aiwilliams.github.com/mlist

== DESCRIPTION:

An insane attempt to build a mail list server library that can be used
other applications very easily. The first target is Ruby applications
that can load MList models for direct integration. It will later have
a RESTful API so that non-Ruby applications can easily integrate. That
may depend heavily on community involvement...

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

There is a LOT to do: segmenting, spam filtering, HTML conversion, i18n,
backscatter - only the Mailman developers know what else. I have enough
experience to know that rewrites are NEVER as easy as they seem. I begin
this with fear and trepidation. Alas, I go boldly forward.

==== Extracting 'from' IP address from emails is not implemented

==== Observing MList ActiveRecord subsclasses (ie, MList::Message, MList::Thread)

ActiveRecord observers are reloaded at each request in development mode. They
will be registered with the MList models each time. Since the MList models are
required once at initialization, there will always only be one instance of the
model class, and therefore, many instances of the observer class (all but the
most recent invalid, since they were undefined) registered with it.

There are a number of ways to solve this, the best being the one that makes things
'just work' such that I can delete this part of the document. For now, do the
following in environment.rb:

* remove the observer from the Rails' config.active_record.observers list
* after the Rails::Initializer.run block, "require 'myobserver'"
* after that require line, "Myobserver.instance"

This will load the observer once, thereby only registering it once with the MList
class you are observing.

== SYNOPSIS:

Let's say you want your web application to have a mailing list feature.
Let's also say you care about the UI, and you don't want to learn all
about creating the correct HTML structures for a mailing list. You want to
have lots of power for searching the mail, and you have your own strategy
for managing the lists. You love Ruby.

== REQUIREMENTS:

You'll need some gems.

* activesupport
* activerecord
* tmail

== INSTALL:

* FIX (sudo gem install, anything else)
