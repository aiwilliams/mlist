= mlist

* FIX (url)

== DESCRIPTION:

An insane attempt to build a mail list server library that can be used
other applications very easily. The first target is Ruby applications
that can load MList models for direct integration. It will later have
a RESTful API so that non-Ruby applications can easily integrate. That
may depend heavily on community involvement...

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

There is a LOT to do: segmenting, spam filtering, HTML conversion, i18n,
backscatter - only the Mailman developers know what else. I have enough
experience to know that rewrites are NEVER as easy as they seem. I begin
this with fear and trepidation. Alas, I go boldly forward.

== SYNOPSIS:

Let's say you want you web application to have a mailing list feature.
Let's also say you care about the UI, and you don't want to learn all
about creating the correct HTML structures for a mailing list. You want to
have lots of power for searching the mail, and you have your own strategy
for managing the lists. You love Ruby.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* FIX (list of requirements)

== INSTALL:

* FIX (sudo gem install, anything else)
