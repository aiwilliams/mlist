It would seem that a poor MUA implementation would not include in- 
reply-to or references headers, thereby leaving us no choice but to  
connect this email by subject. What is the appropriate thing to do?

  a. connect this to the thread that was started first, having the  
same subject
  b. connect this to the thread that was started most recently, having  
the same subject
  c. consider both those emails, looking to see whether there is any  
content in this new email that matches best either of those

I would vote for b. c is far to problematic, and I would guess that b  
covers 90%.
