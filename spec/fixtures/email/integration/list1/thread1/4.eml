Ah ha! Notice the content included from 'On Jan 28, 2009, at 8:09 AM'.  
It does not show the foot from the mailing list - it is only included  
once, at the bottom. Looks like this list is stripping that out. Seems  
like a good idea.

Note that in Mail.app, all the emails having this subject are  
connected as a thread, oldest to newest. So, even Mail.app assumes  
that where the subjects are the same, the discussion is one.
