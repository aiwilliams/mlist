<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So here's our first discussion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;One, this gives&nbsp;us a test run for the new hub and to begin getting feedback from all of you.&nbsp; I researched this a good bit for safety, privacy,&nbsp;function, &nbsp;and this is where I landed.&nbsp;There are some places that do more, but&nbsp;they compromise some security and privacy, and others&nbsp;are just not user friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While there's not tons and tons of features and gadgets, I think it has the basics for us to communicate between groups pretty effectively.&nbsp; &nbsp;I really like that we can have a calendar that provides a way for changes, events, birthdays, whose in charge of snacks for that week, &nbsp;and everyone can add to it as you wish or need.&nbsp; Everyone goes to one calendar and it's always updated because we update as we go.&nbsp; &nbsp; Pretty neat!&nbsp; &nbsp;The member section has a place for our addresses, phone numbers, pictures, and important information all in one place.&nbsp; There is also a place to upload files and photos and I'm sure there is more I haven't played with yet.&nbsp; I think this is going to be especially great to give each other our prayer requests and our praises that happen in between our weekly groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So jump in and get your feet wet and let&nbsp;us know what you think.&nbsp; Feel free to start discussions, share your ideas and thinking on all of this, and mainly just play with it awhile.&nbsp;If anyone is having trouble getting on, locating anything, or has questions, feel free to email me or call me and I'll get right on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone have a blessed week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Him,&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam Williams &nbsp;</p>
