       So here's our first discussion. 

 One, this gives us a test run for the new hub and to begin getting feedback from all of you.  I researched this a good bit for safety, privacy, function,  and this is where I landed. There are some places that do more, but they compromise some security and privacy, and others are just not user friendly. 

While there's not tons and tons of features and gadgets, I think it has the basics for us to communicate between groups pretty effectively.   I really like that we can have a calendar that provides a way for changes, events, birthdays, whose in charge of snacks for that week,  and everyone can add to it as you wish or need.  Everyone goes to one calendar and it's always updated because we update as we go.    Pretty neat!   The member section has a place for our addresses, phone numbers, pictures, and important information all in one place.  There is also a place to upload files and photos and I'm sure there is more I haven't played with yet.  I think this is going to be especially great to give each other our prayer requests and our praises that happen in between our weekly groups. 

     So jump in and get your feet wet and let us know what you think.  Feel free to start discussions, share your ideas and thinking on all of this, and mainly just play with it awhile. If anyone is having trouble getting on, locating anything, or has questions, feel free to email me or call me and I'll get right on it.    Everyone have a blessed week.    In Him,   Adam Williams
